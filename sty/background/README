The `background' package v2.0 offers the placement of quite arbitrary 
background material on the pages of a document. The user can control many 
aspects (i.e., contents, position, color, opacity) of the background 
material that will be displayed. The background material can be modified 
as many times as required and it can be displayed in all the pages or in 
some specifically chosen ones.
